        This privacy policy explains how Tachometer collects, uses, and shares your personal information when you use our app. By using our app, you agree to the terms of this privacy policy.

        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>

        We do not collect any personal information from you when you use our app.

        When you use our app, we collect the current velocity of your device based on your devices location data.

        We do not collect any location data, and we do not use any identifiers, such as the device's unique ID or the user's Apple ID.

        <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>

        We use the velocity data we collect solely for the purpose of displaying your current velocity in our app.

        We do not use your velocity data for any other purpose, and we do not share your data with any third parties.

        <h3>Data Retention</h3>

        We retain the velocity data collected by our app only for as long as necessary to display your current velocity. We do not retain any historical location data or other identifying information.

        <h3>Your Choices</h3>

        You can choose to disable the apps ability to use the Location Services of your device at any time. If you do so, our app will no longer be able to display your current velocity.
